# Create 3 functions
# A math function that takes 2 required arguments, multiplies them together, and then divides by 100
#     and returns the result

# A stringy function that takes a required argument string and returns every other letter from the string

# A main function that calls on both of these previous functions, which has 1 required argument of an integer, and has two default arguments (1 int and 1 string)

# Call on the main function
