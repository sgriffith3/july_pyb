# Handling Errors Challenge

# Create a function that takes a required argument of a list, and an optional parameter of an integer 
# Iterate through each item of the list
# Use a try/except block to "try" to divide each item by your optional integer parameter
# If there is a TypeError, handle it by printing out the value of the error (err) and also printing "Your item ____ is not divisible by ____ " (fill in with item of list, and optional integer)
# Execute the function

# Use the list below (or one like it) to accomplish this task
mixed = ["cats", 24, "lizards", 7, "fish", 300]
